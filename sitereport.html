                            The HyperText Markup Language(HTML), is a standard markup language for texts that are designed to be viewed in a web browser. 
                            It is assisted by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and programming languages like JavaScript. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. 
                            HTML elments are known as the building blocks of HTML page and are delineaded by tags. Tags are of two type: paired and unpaired tags. 
                            Paired tags have both opening and closing tags, such as h1 tag, whereas, Unpaired tag only have one tag such as img tag and is known as 
                            empty elements. HTML tags are not shown by browers, but they are used to comprehend the page content.

                            <!-- Basic introduction to CSS -->
                            CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) is a style sheet language for specifying the appearance of a document written in a markup language like HTML. 
                            CSS is a key component of the World Wide Web, along with HTML and JavaScripy. A declaration block and one or more selectors make up 
                            each rule. It specifies how HTML components should appear on a screen and saves a lot of work. It has the ability to control the layout 
                            of several web pages all at once. CSS supports markup languages like HTML, XHTML, plain XML, SVG and XUL.

                            This website consist of 5 pages: Home, Portfolio, Contact, Work experience and Sitereport pages. For this website, 
                            I got the material from dribble, pintrest and other web platforms. I have used two colors in different shades for this website that are blue and yellow.
                            As using few colors make user friendly and more appropriate to use. I have added hamburger icon to make it more user friendly.
